	abstract = {FESTIM (Finite Element Simulation of Tritium In Materials), is a versatile open-source finite element code developed in Python for simulating hydrogen transport in materials. FESTIM addresses limitations observed in existing codes by enabling multi-dimensional, multi-material simulations, leveraging the flexible finite element method and the open-source FEniCS library. Use cases illustrating FESTIM’s applicability and efficacy are presented: reproduction of thermo-desorption experiments, modelling plasma-facing components (divertor monoblocks), and modelling breeding blankets. A comparative analysis with two other numerical tools (TMAP8 and COMSOL®) is then performed. FESTIM is in very good agreement with these codes and shows similar (or better) computing performances. Finally, the thorough validation and verification (using the method of manufactured solutions) of the code is described, highlighting the code’s reliability.},

	abstract = {The limited tritium resources available for the first fusion power plants (FPPs) make fuel self-sufficiency and tritium inventory minimization leading issues in FPP design. This work builds on the model proposed by Abdou et al (2020 Nucl. Fusion 61 013001), which analyzed the fuel cycle (FC) of a DEMOnstration nuclear FPP-class FPP with a time-dependent system-level model. Here, we use a modified version of their model to analyze the FC of an Affordable, Robust, Compact (ARC)-class tokamak and two versions of a Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production (STEP)-class tokamak. The ARC-class tokamak breeds tritium in a 2LiF + BeF2 liquid immersion blanket, while the STEP-class tokamak breeds tritium utilizing either a liquid-lithium blanket design or an encapsulated breeding blanket. A time-dependent system-level model is developed in Matlab Simulink® to simulate the evolution of tritium flows and tritium inventories in the FC. The main goals of this work are to assess tritium self-sufficiency of the ARC- and STEP-class designs and to determine quantitative design requirements that can be used to analyze the adequacy of a proposed FC system. These design requirements are aimed at achieving a low tritium inventory doubling time () and a low start-up inventory () while keeping the required tritium breeding ratio (TBR) as low as possible. We also consider how improvements in FC technology and POs affect TBR and . The model results show that TBR for ARC- and STEP-class FPPs should be achievable if the tritium burn efficiency (TBE) reaches 0.5\%–1\% (TBR1.2). This assumes significant, but attainable, improvements over current abilities. However, the model results indicate that an FPP must achieve ambitious performance targets, including FPP availability 70\%, tritium processing time 4 h, and the implementation of direct internal recycling (DIR). If future research yields major improvements to achievable TBE, it may be possible to achieve tritium self-sufficiency while operating at lower availability and without implementing DIR.},

	abstract = {The dynamic analysis of fusion power plant (FPP) fuel cycles highlights the challenge of achieving tritium self-sufficiency in future FPPs. While state-of-the-art fuel cycle models offer valuable insights into the necessary design parameters for attaining tritium self-sufficiency, none of these models currently consider the impact of tritium trapping within fuel cycle components. However, detailed analysis of individual components reveals that substantial amounts of tritium can be trapped within the first wall, divertors, and breeding blanket systems, suggesting that tritium trapping may significantly influence the FPP ability to achieve self-sufficiency. The compounded effects of additional tritium traps generated by irradiation effects and component replacements further exacerbate this challenge. The novelty of this work is the integration of an explicit, physics-based model for tritium trapping, evolution of damage-induced traps, and component replacements into a dynamic, system-level model of a fuel cycle. The results show an increase of a factor of tritium inventory in the first wall and vacuum vessel of an ARC-class FPP when accounting for the aforementioned phenomena. This, coupled with the replacement of components subject to significant tritium trapping, slows down fuel cycle dynamics, resulting in an extended tritium doubling time (50\% increase), higher start-up inventory (30\% increase), and higher required tritium breeding ratio (2\%–5\%) compared to a scenario without tritium trapping.},
