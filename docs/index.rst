===============================
Statement of Need
===============================

Fusion fuel cycle modeling is a critical aspect of nuclear engineering that requires sophisticated tools to analyze material flows, reactor performance, and waste management strategies. The Fuel Cycle Simulator addresses the need for:

**Accessibility**
   Traditional fuel cycle simulation tools are often complex, proprietary, or require extensive training. This tool provides an intuitive visual interface that makes fuel cycle modeling accessible to students, researchers, and professionals.

**Interactivity**
   Static models and command-line tools limit exploration and understanding. Our interactive visual approach allows users to build, modify, and experiment with fuel cycle scenarios in real-time.

**Educational Value**
   The visual nature of the tool makes it ideal for teaching fuel cycle concepts, allowing students to see the connections between different components and understand material flows.

**Research Flexibility**
   Researchers need tools that can be easily modified and extended. The open-source nature and modular architecture enable customization for specific research needs.

**Modern Technology Stack**
   Built with modern web technologies (React, Python) that ensure maintainability, extensibility, and cross-platform compatibility.

Installation Guide
===============================

System Requirements
-------------------

Before installing the Fuel Cycle Simulator, ensure your system meets the following requirements:

**Required Software:**
   - Node.js 18+ and npm
   - Python 3.8 or higher
   - pip for Python package management
   - Git (for development)

**Supported Operating Systems:**
   - Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+, CentOS 8+)
   - macOS 10.15+
   - Windows 10+

Installation Steps
------------------

1. **Clone the Repository**
   
   .. code-block:: bash
   
      git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fuel-cycle-sim.git
      cd fuel-cycle-sim

2. **Install Frontend Dependencies**
   
   .. code-block:: bash
   
      npm install

3. **Set Up Python Environment**
   
   We recommend using a virtual environment:
   
   .. code-block:: bash
   
      # Create virtual environment
      python -m venv venv
      
      # Activate virtual environment
      # On Linux/macOS:
      source venv/bin/activate
      
      # On Windows:
      venv\Scripts\activate

4. **Install Backend Dependencies**
   
   .. code-block:: bash
   
      pip install -r requirements.txt

5. **Verify Installation**
   
   .. code-block:: bash
   
      # Run both frontend and backend
      npm run start:both

   The application should be available at:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:5173
   - Backend API: http://localhost:8000

Troubleshooting
---------------

**Common Issues:**

- **Node.js version conflicts**: Use nvm to manage Node.js versions
- **Python path issues**: Ensure Python 3.8+ is in your PATH
- **Port conflicts**: Check if ports 5173 or 8000 are already in use
- **Permission errors**: Use appropriate permissions for installation directories
